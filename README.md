# ch7studentScores

Create a project that uses a structure for information about a student and test scores. The struct needs an integer for the student ID, strings for the student first name and last name, and doubles for 3 scores. In this project, ask the user for the information about 3 students, stored in a structure for each student. Display each student's information and calculate their average on the 3 tests. Display the test scores and calculate and display the average for each test.

 Here is an image showing what the results might look like:

Create a function to store data for a single student -- pass the student structure by reference. In the main function, call this function 3 times, once for each of 3 different students.

Create a function to display the data for a single student -- pass the student structure by constant reference. In this function, calculate the student's average for the 3 tests and display that average. In the main function, call this display function 3 times, once for each student. 

Create a function to calculate and display the averages for the 3 tests. Pass all 3 structures by constant reference and call it once from the main function.

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for two sets of data (do not include the data in the image above), and compare your results to those test cases. Run the project twice, with the test case data, and take a screenshot of the results.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases, AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
